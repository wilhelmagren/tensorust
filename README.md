Tensorust is a general purpose tensor library written in Rust. It features noo C/C++ bindings, which are usually used by e.g. Tensorflow and PyTorch. This is pure Rust. It features dynamic building of the tensor DAG and performs automatic gradient calculation. Currently only supports Float16 operations.
